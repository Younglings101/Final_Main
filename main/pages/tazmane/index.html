                        <h4>
                            The question of who we are arises often. I am a mixture of my influences, my surroundings and my life experiences.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            Bubbly by nature, driven by choice and extremely attentive. I have a strong personality and tend to lead however I strongly
                            believe that we are stronger together than alone.
                        </h4>
                        <h4>
                            I spent three years of my life living in a boarding, the school I attended was extremely different to what I was used to.
                            Its sole purpose was largely to give children that showed potential in math and science an opportunity
                            to access a very good education. Especially to those whose parents were not in a position to
                            afford it.
                        </h4>

                        <h4>
                            Those three years made me a lot less dependent on my parents and friends, it really challenged my understanding of the world.
                            In doing so it allowed me to question a lot and also become more assure of who I am. It taught
                            me patients, empathy, tolerance and understand because those in conjunction with honestly and
                            mainly respect allowing for really good interpersonal skills and conflict resolution.</h4>
