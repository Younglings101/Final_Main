            <strong><p>I'm <i>Aphelele Lupondo</i>. well known as <big>Billy</big><br>
      I was born in 1997 the 6th of June. It was on a Friday. Went to a Roman catholic primary school. So I mentioned that cause it built me morally. Then after I went to a high school closeby home.
    Where I faced a lot of challenges. I conformed under the standard of those challenges until it was time to grow. Then when I matured I was able to over come that.</p></strong>
        </p>
        

        <h2>Me Generally</h2>
      <strong><p > I did a lot of sport as a youngstar. I did soccer,cricket,rugby and track running. I then there after focused on soccer until I broke my ankle then I did play league games anymore I only played friendlies. I then volunteered to a NGO(Kuyasa Horizon Empowerment) for soccer coaching while I was in grade 11 and 12. I don't know how I did that but I did it. Now I'm no longer volunteering for soccer but for community development projects. I'm quite a person who doesn't rest.</p></strong>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
    
      <strong>  <p style="color:#ffe2e;"> Currently I'm an intern at <i>Absa Cowboy Aliens</i>. I got to this point through perseverance and hardwork. As a High school student I did IT as as an extra subject an after school program.
	The program was with Oracle Academy for three years. Last year(2016) I was in Grade 12 and I passed my matric with a Diploma. Did a Post Matric program with Oracle Academy at CapaCiti.
      </p>
	<br>
	<p style="color: #ffe2e;">At the school program I learned about the basic java fundamentals. When I got at the PM program I learne beyond my expectations I learned about Java,HTML 5,CSS 3, JavaScript
		And AngularJS. We didn't cover all in dept but I belive there's always room to learn more things. The program gave me skills independently programming skills but not only that but soft skills as 
		well to make me ready for the corporate world.
