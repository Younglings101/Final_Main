Afer matric I applied in CPUT, that's where I wantend to study for the following year which was 2012,</br>
but things didn't go ahead as planned. This is when I decided  join Vida e Caffe, </br> and that's when I became 
a fully qualified Barista.</br>
</br>
I then worked for the catering company Fedics as a Barista aswell and I was based at Absa (Aliens)</br>
As I was making and serving coffees at the Aliens office, as the time goes by, I got intrested in what they are doing</br>
which was programming, I was always asking them all the technical based questions</br>
and I was granted an opportunity which was to study programming while I was working.</br>
</br>
At first Roger gave me lessons spending an hour twice a week, obviously this was not enough and sometimes he wouldn't have time</br>
to teach me as he also have work to do, that is when I decided to carry on studying by myself taking online tutorals,</br> text books
that I got from the people in the office as they were also very supportive </br>
This obviously meant that I should put extra amount of time after hours of studying afer work.</br>

This is where I got an amazing opportunity to do a full 6 months course after I realized that there are deep concepts</br>
that I cannot cover by myself or my mentor Roger Weiss. This is when I decided that I really need to attend the full time Java short course</br>
at Oracle University, which is the school that the previous interns at the Aliens office are coming from and brought them positive opportunities</br>
for their future.
